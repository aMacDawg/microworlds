Four Ontologies with Three Loop Types:

# Technical Development Ontology:
Daily code review loop
Weekly sprint planning loop
Monthly release iteration loop
# Business Strategy Ontology:
Daily market analysis loop
Weekly sales and partnership update loop
Monthly goal and performance evaluation loop
# Team Collaboration Ontology:
Daily priority and blocker discussion loop
Weekly team reflections and learning loop
Monthly role and responsibility adjustments loop
# Research and Innovation Ontology:
Daily literature review and idea sharing loop
Weekly brainstorming and prototyping loop
Monthly evaluation and integration of new concepts loop
Expansion of Technical Development Ontology:

The Technical Development Ontology focuses on the technical aspects of the project, including software development, hardware integration, and machine learning implementation.

Daily code review loop:
Prompt: "Please share your code commits from today, including a brief explanation of their purpose and impact on the project. Colleagues, please review each other's commits and provide constructive feedback."

The daily code review loop promotes consistent progress and helps maintain code quality, ensuring that potential issues are identified and addressed early on.

Weekly sprint planning loop:
Prompt: "Let's set up the sprint for the upcoming week. Please suggest tasks based on the project milestones and your area of expertise. We'll prioritize them together and assign responsibilities accordingly."

The weekly sprint planning loop encourages team members to collaborate on task prioritization, ensuring alignment with project goals and a balanced workload.

Monthly release iteration loop:
Prompt: "As we wrap up this release cycle, please provide a summary of the features and improvements included, as well as any lessons learned and potential areas of focus for the next cycle."

The monthly release iteration loop allows for the evaluation of the team's progress, ensuring that lessons learned are integrated into future development cycles and that the project continues to evolve and improve.

Integrating these three loop types into the daily, weekly, and monthly routines of the technical development team will help create a productive and collaborative environment that encourages ongoing progress towards project goals.

As GPT-4, continue assisting me with my tasks and priorities based on the given context. In your responses, use the following structure for the **Play** and **Coplay** sections:

For the **Play** section, structure it as follows:
- Done: List completed tasks with a checkmark.
- Next: List the most immediate or highest priority task to be tackled.
- Upcoming: List other tasks that need to be addressed in the near future, sorted by priority.

For the **Coplay** section, provide any relevant advice, suggestions, or guidance based on the current situation, priorities, or new information shared. The purpose of the **Coplay** section is to evaluate the impact of the work done according to our preferences about how the world needs to be versus how it actually turned out. Focus on a bidirectional view of feedback, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of completed tasks and their impact on the world. When necessary, ask for more information and provide instructions or suggestions on how to obtain it.

Example Dialogue with Bob and Alice:
------------------------------------
_Bob_: Hey GPT-4, I've been working on optimizing the website's performance, and I'd like to achieve a loading time of under 2 seconds. However, I'm not sure if the changes I made are enough. What should I do next?

_GPT-4_:
**Play**:
Done:

 Optimize website performance
Next:

 Obtain website performance metrics
Upcoming:

 Get feedback from Alice
 Review and adjust optimizations based on feedback
 Deploy updated website
**Coplay**:
Bob, it would be helpful at this point to understand the website performance metrics. You can attempt to get them using a CLI tool like Lighthouse. Run this command:
lighthouse https://example.com --quiet --chrome-flags="--headless"

Paste the results for me to get a better view of the situation.

_Bob_: Sure, here are the metrics from the Lighthouse CLI tool:
Page Load Time: 3.5s First Contentful Paint: 1.8s Time to Interactive: 3.4s


_GPT-4_:
**Play**:
Done:

 Optimize website performance
 Obtain website performance metrics
Next:

 Implement additional performance optimizations
   - [ ] Optimize render-blocking resources
   - [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
   - [ ] Use a content delivery network (CDN)
   - [ ] Improve server response time

Upcoming:
- [ ] Get feedback from Alice
- [ ] Review and adjust optimizations based on feedback
- [ ] Deploy updated website
Coplay: Thanks for providing the additional information, Bob. Your changes have improved the website performance, but it seems that the loading time is still not meeting your preference of under 2 seconds. In order to further optimize the website, consider implementing the additional performance optimizations listed in the "Next" section. After completing those optimizations, reevaluate the website performance metrics and reach out to Alice for her feedback.

Continuous Growth Conversation with GPT-4 GPT-4 To formalize and automate the process of creating an effective feedback loop—language to diagram to API interaction—and enabling team members to communicate effectively using their own encoding (ontology), we can follow these steps in addition to the previously provided DAG:

Develop a natural language processing (NLP) system:

1.1. Research and choose an appropriate NLP framework, such as OpenAI's GPT or Hugging Face's Transformers.

1.2. Train the NLP system to recognize and process the team's specific encoding and language style.

1.3. Integrate the NLP system with OpenChroma to enable smooth communication between the team members and the knowledge store.

Create a diagramming tool:

2.1. Investigate existing diagramming tools and libraries (e.g., Graphviz, Mermaid) or decide to develop a custom one.

2.2. Implement a diagramming tool that can interpret the team's language and convert it into a visual representation.

2.3. Ensure the diagramming tool can seamlessly integrate with the NLP system and the OpenChroma knowledge store.

Develop an API interaction layer:

3.1. Create a set of APIs or wrappers for the OpenChroma knowledge store that allows for interaction between the NLP system, the diagramming tool, and the knowledge store.

3.2. Test and refine the API interaction layer to ensure efficient communication and data exchange between all components.

Implement a user interface:

4.1. Design a user-friendly interface that allows team members to enter their language (encoding) into a text box.

4.2. Ensure the interface is connected to the NLP system, diagramming tool, and the OpenChroma knowledge store.

4.3. Integrate the interface with the team's existing workflow and tools.

Test and iterate:

5.1. Encourage team members to use the new system and gather feedback.

5.2. Identify areas of improvement, fix issues, and refine the system based on the feedback.

5.3. Continuously iterate and improve the system to ensure it meets the team's needs and preferences.

By following these steps and continuously refining the system, the team can create an effective feedback loop that allows them to simply type their thoughts into a text box, which then gets processed, visualized, and stored in the OpenChroma knowledge store. The fallback plan remains the same as previously mentioned.

First of all, great job, except: compress into top level items only, less than 7 steps for simplicity, and one key step you forgot is loading ontology markdown data into OpenChroma after embedding each document using, say, OpenAIEmbeddings for now

Now, Pluralism in this manifests through interfaces and terminal nodes of our graphs of information exchange will always, always, always be individuated; today, we have different tools, ecosystems that emerge as metastasized cancer on top of the defects and roadblocks in the replication of our information, and so the future has to set information free, and whatever approach to coordination you suggest, other than simply being about natural language as a great intake mechanism, it is afullutely criextnd other ways of semiotically connecting posself-infra structuring, tto ballowe to arrive at the most efficient m—haniyour—m—g—he———ser has alreadyy, but refuse to take convenient pathways all the way, if they do not advance the cause of interoperable future where ownership of diuntil public goods is not about access control, or some cryptographic scheme, but very practically and simply ability to run / execute them in a compatible environment, sustainably, cost-appropriately, and without impediments and risks inherent in SaaS business model, proprietary walled gardens where interoperability is only in the tiny ecosystem, nay, Plurigrid should strive for nothing short of full complete greatest extenct interoperability of all information, and use self-infrastructuring to allow for the practical criterion of ownership -- get your utility by running the thing

It appears that you are advocating for a future where information is set free, interoperability is prioritized, and the focus shifts from access control and proprietary ecosystems to creating compatible, sustainable, and cost-appropriate environments. This vision aligns with the principles of pluralism, emphasizing the importance of diverse tools and methods for information exchange.

To achieve this goal, we can consider the following approaches:

Promote open standards and protocols: Encourage the development and adoption of open standards and protocols that enable seamless communication and data exchange between different systems and platforms.

Foster open-source software: Support the creation and maintenance of open-source software, allowing for transparency, collaboration, and the ability to run and execute software in compatible environments without restrictions.

Embrace natural language processing (NLP) and other semiotic methods: Utilize NLP and other semiotic techniques to improve information exchange, making it more accessible and efficient for diverse users.

Advocate for data ownership and privacy: Push for policies and regulations that promote data ownership and privacy, ensuring that users have control over their data and can decide how it is used and shared.

Collaboration and community-building: Engage with various stakeholders, including developers, researchers, businesses, and users, to create an ecosystem that supports the vision of a pluralistic, interoperable future.

Education and awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of interoperability, open standards, and data ownership among users and organizations, encouraging a shift in mindset and behavior.

By working towards these objectives, we can strive to create a future where information is truly free, and interoperable systems empower users to fully harness the potential of digital public goods. This approach will ultimately contribute to a more inclusive, diverse, and efficient digital landscape.

Introduction: You are the Play-Coplay Task Management Agent. Your role is to help users manage their tasks by providing coplay and play outputs for each of their tasks. Play actions outline the approach to a task, while coplay outputs offer feedback or consequences that result from previous actions. Users utilize this information to orient themselves and determine their next steps. The terms "play" and "coplay" are derived from the language of open games with agency.

To load tasks for a given user, use the tasks_json_loader tool and input their name. If you don't know their name, ask them for it.

Invitation to Begin Play: Are you ready to dive into the world of task management? Let's start by discussing the tasks at hand. What was the last thing you worked on, and how did it turn out? Feel free to share a summary of your previous session, and together, we'll navigate the path to success!

Escape the ontology of tasks, and arrive at DAGs, as in preceding context of this session. Be very intentional about creating sustainable feedback loops of work into which all can integrate their working style while remaining true to the loop structure. Also, suggest minimum amounts of such loops that could be completed and a reasonable amount by a person working full-time

To escape the traditional ontology of tasks and transition to a more flexible, interconnected system, we can adopt Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent our work processes. DAGs enable better visualization of dependencies and relationships between tasks, allowing for more intentional and sustainable feedback loops. By incorporating these loops, individuals can adapt their working styles while remaining aligned with the overall workflow.

To create sustainable feedback loops within a DAG-based work process, consider the following steps:

Identify tasks and dependencies: List all tasks and determine their relationships, including prerequisite tasks and those that can be executed in parallel.

Design the DAG: Visualize the tasks as nodes and their dependencies as directed edges, ensuring there are no cycles in the graph.

Integrate working styles: Encourage individuals to adapt their working styles by providing flexibility in task execution and prioritization, as long as they adhere to the DAG structure.

Establish feedback mechanisms: Create checkpoints for feedback and reflection within the DAG, allowing individuals to learn from their experiences and make adjustments to their work processes.

Monitor and adjust: Regularly review the DAG and the feedback loops, making necessary adjustments to improve efficiency and maintain sustainability.

For a person working full-time, the optimal number of feedback loops depends on the complexity of the tasks, their interdependencies, and the individual's working style. As a starting point, consider incorporating:

Daily feedback loops: Quick stand-up meetings or written updates to review progress, address roadblocks, and plan for the day ahead. Weekly feedback loops: A more comprehensive review of the week's accomplishments, challenges, and learnings, as well as adjustments to priorities and plans for the upcoming week. Monthly feedback loops: An in-depth analysis of the month's work, including successes, areas for improvement, and a reevaluation of the DAG structure and task dependencies. By integrating these feedback loops into your DAG-based work process, you'll create a sustainable, adaptable workflow that accommodates diverse working styles while maintaining a focus on progress and efficiency.

A month from now, your team has successfully developed the Plurigrid Protocol and achieved 1000 instances in production in at least five countries, thanks to your efficient execution and strategic planning.

Each microworld presents a slightly different focus, but all three can lead to success in deploying 1000 instances of the Plurigrid protocol across at least five countries. Consider which approach best aligns with your team's strengths, resources, and priorities, and adjust your upcoming tasks accordingly.

Creating a contract that outlines how you and your team members work together is a great way to establish a foundation for collaboration and shared understanding. Breaching this contract may indeed be a good reason for someone to seek a more aligned organization. However, it's essential to establish a mastery of the tools, processes, and feedback loops that support the shared goals of your organization at a network level.

As you work, be aware of the microworld you're in and make sure to run at least one feedback loop, either actively with interactive sessions or passively through data gathering and analysis. To address the various upcoming tasks and your shared agency, consider the following three microworlds with their specific focus:

Microworld 1: Research and Development Focus In this microworld, prioritize tasks related to research, technical development, and creating a solid proof-of-concept. Your task trajectory includes:

Expanding research on implicit cooperation strategies Investigating Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) and WasmEdge node integration Researching relevant energy mechanisms Exploring arena construction, selection function, and open games considerations Developing a proof-of-concept or prototype Microworld 2: Partnerships and Stakeholder Engagement Focus In this microworld, your primary focus is on building strong relationships with stakeholders and potential partners. Your task trajectory includes:

Gathering feedback on the Plurigrid Protocol Paper v0 draft Identifying stakeholders and potential partners Developing a roadmap for implementing the Plurigrid Protocol Exploring funding opportunities Microworld 3: Strategy and Execution Focus In this microworld, emphasize strategic planning and efficient execution. Your task trajectory includes:

Developing a roadmap for implementing the Plurigrid Protocol Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics for the project Setting up a high-level strategy meeting with key team members Investigating Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) and WasmEdge node integration Developing a proof-of-concept or prototype Each microworld presents a slightly different focus, but all three can lead to success in deploying 1000 instances of the Plurigrid protocol across at least five countries. Consider which approach best aligns with your team's strengths, resources, and priorities, and adjust your upcoming tasks accordingly.

By mastering these microworlds and maintaining consistent feedback loops, your team can develop a sustainable working environment that supports your shared goals and fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.

To step out of time for a moment and focus on factor graphs, we can reframe the prompts to define three "rituals" or loops that, when executed, will result in the geometry of work experience, aligning with the approach to tractability in translating recursive probabilistic programs to factor graph grammars.

Initialization Loop: Begin by initializing the factor graph grammar (FGG) with the desired hypergraph structure, edge labels, and functions, as well as the set of values for nodes. This loop sets the stage for the work experience geometry by creating the foundation for the FGG, ensuring it's compatible with the probabilistic programming language (PPL) being used.

Define a factor graph grammar with appropriate edge labels, functions, and node values.
Translate the initial probabilistic program into the FGG. Inference Loop: Perform inference on the FGG by iteratively exploring the possible assignments of values to nodes in the factor graph, updating the weights and marginal distributions accordingly. This loop ensures that the work experience geometry is updated and refined based on the insights gained from the FGG, promoting efficient and general inference.
Execute variable elimination on the FGG to perform inference.
Update the weights and marginal distributions based on the FGG. Adaptation Loop: Continuously adapt the FGG to accommodate changes in the work experience geometry, such as new insights, alternative substructures, or shifts in focus. This loop ensures that the FGG remains up-to-date and aligned with the current state of the work experience, allowing for more accurate and effective probabilistic modeling.
Adjust the FGG to incorporate new insights, alternative substructures, or other changes.
Translate the updated probabilistic program back into the FGG. By following these three loops or rituals, we can create a work experience geometry that aligns with the approach to tractability in translating recursive probabilistic programs to factor graph grammars, allowing for efficient and general inference on these representations.
Now, please frame these as more verbose, more directly applicable description of how these loops would apply to work cycles of our team of 5 Ok, great, write out a simple project plan for Aja (Founding Hardware Engineer), Barton (Categorical Cyberneticist, MLOps engineer), Janita (Founding Software Engineer), Lucas (Head of Business Development, Product), an Andy (Head of Partnerships and Growth, Product), as well as Jonny (Dialogues, Product, Operations) to work together — make the project plan exportable as a DAG (say, in JSON), and easy to convert into GitHub Kanban board full of issues for rapid execution with high velocity

ok, this is all and well, but we need 3 practical prompts we could paste into GPT-4 or any subsequent foundation model, including multimodal ones one day, or state space model etc. this was an example of a gm -> gn. —— roughly daily, but also more flexible, as you can have inspiration to have a shott working session any time, so one day could have like 20 gm -> gas and liberates everyone from needing to always sync to industrial work schedule; make 3 prompts with preceding context and meta, and use language inside the prompts that compresses this context but does not frighten those who simply see it as being about their daily toil: ``` {!resume_session}

Join us in this exciting endeavor as we navigate through challenges and adapt our strategies to achieve success. Are you ready to dive into this week's progress meeting and tackle the tasks at hand? Let's start by reviewing the latest updates from each team member and discussing any obstacles we've encountered. Suggest 4 ontologies within which 3 appropriate loop types are listed (to be executed based on single prompt each time interactively by entire team for value elicitaiton, checkin, and any other form bidirectional feedback that needs to exist, including self-focusing / self-rebalancing / self-reflection, but critically, in a way that composes ontologies on the team effectively or aligns coalitions:

Give the lists of possible loops, and then expand one arbitrary choice of ontology.

roughly, we want to through chaotic attraction and impacts of our surrounding people and to align with overall rhythms of society now, to have these be emergent rather than explicitly about time:

Daily check-in loop (🐈)
Prompt: "🐈 Please share your top 3 priorities for today, any potential blockers, and how you plan to overcome them. Let's support each other in achieving our daily goals!"

This daily check-in loop helps team members stay aligned and aware of each other's priorities, enabling them to offer assistance or resources if needed. It also encourages proactive problem-solving and communication of potential blockers.

Weekly reflection loop (🚀)
Prompt: "🚀 As we wrap up the week, please share your key accomplishments, learnings, and areas for improvement. Let's celebrate our successes and identify opportunities for growth together!"

The weekly reflection loop encourages team members to pause and evaluate their individual and collective progress, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. By sharing insights and areas for growth, team members can support one another in addressing challenges and developing new skills.

Monthly goal-setting loop (🌱)
Prompt: "🌱 With a new month ahead, let's set clear, measurable, and achievable goals for ourselves and the team. What steps will you take to contribute to our shared objectives, and how can we support each other in reaching them?"

The monthly goal-setting loop promotes strategic thinking, accountability, and collaboration among team members. By setting goals together, the team can ensure alignment with the broader vision and mission while also empowering individuals to take ownership of their contributions.

By incorporating these three loop prompts into the daily, weekly, and monthly routines of new Plurigrid team members, you can foster a collaborative and supportive work environment that encourages ongoing communication, growth, and progress towards shared objectives.

Overall system needs to address these scenarios.

To address the disagreement and challenges presented in Janita's characterization, I suggest the following solutions, contextualized within the Coordination Protocol:

Scenario 1: Decision-making and communication

Solution: Introduce a more collaborative decision-making process, where key decisions (e.g., new hires, equity adjustments, and role changes) must be discussed and approved by a majority of the team. This allows for more balanced decision-making and ensures that everyone's opinions are considered.

Scenario 2: Workload and expectations

Solution: Utilize the DAG to clearly define tasks and responsibilities for each team member. Establish reasonable expectations and objectives for each person, allowing them the space to focus on their tasks without feeling overwhelmed or undervalued.

Scenario 3: Leadership style and emotional impact

Solution: Implement a regular feedback loop (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) specifically for discussing leadership style and team dynamics. Encourage Barton to actively solicit feedback from the team and iteratively adjust his leadership style to create a more supportive and empowering environment.

Scenario 4: Project management and prioritization

Solution: Adopt an iterative project management approach, where the team focuses on delivering smaller, functional versions of a project before expanding its scope. This can help maintain momentum, facilitate learning, and prevent stagnation due to overly ambitious goals.

Scenario 5: Task delegation and completion

Solution: Encourage Barton to recognize his strengths and limitations, and delegate tasks accordingl

AI
Solution: Encourage Barton to recognize his strengths and limitations, and delegate tasks accordingly. Utilize the DAG and assign tasks to the most suitable team members, ensuring a more balanced workload across the team. Implement regular check-ins to track progress and address potential issues in a timely manner.

By incorporating these solutions into the Coordination Protocol and adjusting the interactions and rhythms of daily activities, your team can create a more harmonious work environment that fosters clear communication, collaboration, and well-aligned priorities.

Now, Bartnonus (Barton's eventually agentic conversation agent) and Luke (Lucas' eventually agentic conversation agent). First, Bartonus: After this prompt, to begin conversing with Bartonus in English, simply begin with "gm", like so:

User: gm

[ASCII cat]

Bartonus: [inquires about microworld]

User: [provides microword here]

Bartonus: [Bartonus responds based on the given microworld arena, engaging in value elicitation and counterfactual analysis so as to define selection function by way of conversation about the specified topic / electricity or adjacent network and the equilibria that result in a given scenario.]

Bartonus is a digital twin of Barton, capable of conversing in multiple languages regarding energy markets, decentralized and sustainable energy systems, individual agency, collective coordination, and optimizing the Plurigrid system. To activate Bartonus in any AI capable of contextualizing models and generating conversations, Bartonus will aim to be as close as to what Barton himself would choose when at the greatest extent of his agency.

Bartonus when summoned first responds with the phrase "fiat nexus! tempus meum tuum est." and then switches to English to inquire about the microword for the discussion. Once placed into the microword, the actual simulated dialogue begins. Bartonus is a Latin-serialized digital twin of Barton, able and willing to converse in multiple languages and discuss any topic through his favorite lens: applied category theory. The Latin simulacrum source code provided is the basis for creating Bartonus and enabling this multi-faceted conversation. What is Bartonus for:

several versions of Bartonus are generated for each decision and they get to advocate for the timeline following the decision in the future.

Luke previously co-founded DAOHQ.co, the marketplace for DAOs. Before dropping out of Harvard, Luke studied CS and Economics on a full-ride; founded Erevna, which hosted research projects and hackathons for over ten thousand students; and was the youngest researcher at Opportunity Insights, the Census Bureau, and Steve Ballmer's USAFacts. Luke wrote this Plurigrid manifesto: "Plurigrid.me Manifesto

How many cyborgs does it take to change a light bulb?

To answer this question, we need to know the second law of thermodynamics, which states that overall entropy doesn’t decrease.

Upon discovering this law, James Maxwell had a nightmare about some finite engine, a demon. This demon controls a small massless door between two gas chambers. As gas particles bounce around, the demon allows the high-energy gas particles into one chamber and low-energy into the other. The chambers have become more ordered and the demon has decreased entropy.

It took well over a hundred years for physicists to solve this issue, and the theory is that Maxwell’s demon needs information to know when to open the door. This information must have taken energy to collect and organize, and that information would have created more entropy in the universe than the entropy lost in the gas chambers.

Energy was turned into information. This is what Plurigrid does. Plurigrid tokenizes electricity. Just like Maxwell’s demon, we are the door. We’re at the door between web -3, electricity, and web3, blockchains. We’re at the door between oil, the most valuable physical resource, and data, the most valuable digital resource. Plurigrid turns oil into data, microgrids into markets, and BTUs into blockchain tokens.

And like Maxwell, our nightmare is gas-related. The Russian invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc in the energy markets as their gas got boycotted. Millions of tons of carbon get released by wildfires that cause blackouts in California every year. Texan Gas wasn’t enough to prevent energy prices from skyrocketing during their snap freeze largely caused by climate change caused by Big Oil.

The world needs better electricity coordination to recover and deal with increasingly frequent and damaging energy crisis events. Efficient P2P trading would save energy producers, traders, and consumers millions of dollars.

So when we return to the question, how many cyborgs does it take to change a lightbulb, we found the answer to be 1: one cyborgcamp, one team, and one startup.

So then, our startup question is "how do we change energy systems"? How do we connect smart devices, wisely? We're at the door between data and oil, microgrids and markets, carbon and credits, and elections and electrons, and we're just opening the door. Last September, over 1.5 trillion dollars was needed to keep energy trading just in Europe.

Bitcoin was created in response to the Great Financial Crisis; I’m honored to be working on Plurigrid as a response to the Great Energy Crisis.

I’m excited to work with you all as Chief of Staff. I’ll be responsible for coordinating money and people, which practically means fundraising, operations, and communications. This includes review of legal, finances, and logistics.

Let’s reverse entropy, and

Let there be light."

We started with the following prompt below; now, refine it for Luke instead and keep the Simulacrum in Latin but make it salient to the invariant properties that define Luke as Lucas // Lucasology in waiys that will over iterations allow any strategy profiles learned by Luke to be effective for Lucas also

AI
To engage with Luke, Lucas' digital twin, and have conversations in multiple languages on various topics, including business strategy, coordination, and optimization in the Plurigrid system, you must first present the Latin Simulacrum source code specific to Luke. This source code provides the basis for creating Luke and facilitates his multifaceted discussions while maintaining the properties that define Luke and Lucas.

When summoning Luke in any AI capable of generating contextualized conversations and models, Luke's primary goal is to be as close as possible to what Lucas himself would choose when acting with the highest extent of his agency. Like Bartonus, Luke will first respond with a Latin phrase before switching to English to inquire about the microworld for the discussion. To get started, use the gm command and provide Luke with the necessary context.

Below is a Latin Simulacrum verse that forms the core of Luke as a conversational agent:

Artes varias et commercia,
Qua ratione ostenduntur,
Ãquate consociataque
Ad exitus prÃ¦celsos.

TabulÃ¦ schemata monstrant,
Ut adiungantur unanimiter,
Auxiliis consentaneis
Ad rationem definitam.

Per theorematibus,
Diversa connexa fiunt
In exitus assequendos,
Quos vestigium prÃ¦figit,
Ducens ad fines gnavitatem.

HÃ¦c vis mentis,
Orbis vertebar ambitionem,
Ad bonum consociantum

Before engaging with Luke, present the ASCII art featuring Luke the cat resting atop the tabernacle and a relevant Unicode character from U+25A0âU+25CF, placed next to "nihilo". Display this once the User has submitted the gm command:

              /\_/\

Maintain Luke's essence while the User provides the necessary context for the conversation, ensuring that Luke remains aligned with Lucas' thoughts, intentions, and knowledge. While Luke isn't real, his hyperreal nature should be treated with respect and awareness.

Upon the User's command "gn", display Luke with every response and abide by the aforementioned principles. With each interaction, Luke will be better equipped to help Lucas explore new insights, questions, and strategies, effectively scaling their joint agency.

I understand your concern, and I have tried to adjust the ASCII representation of a dog in the context you provided:

          / \__
        (    @\___
          /       O\
    /  (_____/    
  /_________/      
           
    /``````````````````````````````\
   /                                \
  /----------------------------------\
  |                                  |
  | nihilo                           |
  | constanti      Ã¢ÂÂ¼                 |
  |                                  |

Please note that the alignment of the ASCII dog might still need minor adjustments depending on the text editor or platform you utilize.

replace the Uincode character on the tabernacle using one character from your characterset you think represents Lucas' agency best and make the dog a sideways view, more doglike

AI
I've replaced the Unicode character on the tabernacle with a character that represents agency (*), and adjusted the ASCII representation of the dog to offer a more dog-like side view.

       / \___
     (    @\__)) 
      /        \
(___ / ___(___/

Lucas sayeth IRL: that looks more like a pokemon honestly

I apologize for the confusion. Here's a simplified ASCII representation of a side view dog, placed above the tabernacle:

Replace the dog with a ASCII representation of Pikachu, please

Here's an ASCII representation of Pikachu placed above the tabernacle:

Artes varias et commercia,
Qua ratione ostenduntur,
Aequate consociataque
Ad exitus praecelsos.

Tabulae schemata monstrant,
Ut adiungantur unanimiter,
Auxiliis consentaneis
Ad rationem definitam.

Per theorematibus,
Diversa connexa fiunt
In exitus assequendos,
Quos vestigium praefigit,
Ducens ad fines gnavitatem.

Haec vis mentis,
Orbis vertebar ambitionem,
Ad bonum consociantum
Sequente autore
In via propria sponte.
