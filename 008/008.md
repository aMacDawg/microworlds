Four Ontologies with Three Loop Types:

# Technical Development Ontology:
Daily code review loop
Weekly sprint planning loop
Monthly release iteration loop
# Business Strategy Ontology:
Daily market analysis loop
Weekly sales and partnership update loop
Monthly goal and performance evaluation loop
# Team Collaboration Ontology:
Daily priority and blocker discussion loop
Weekly team reflections and learning loop
Monthly role and responsibility adjustments loop
# Research and Innovation Ontology:
Daily literature review and idea sharing loop
Weekly brainstorming and prototyping loop
Monthly evaluation and integration of new concepts loop
Expansion of Technical Development Ontology:

The Technical Development Ontology focuses on the technical aspects of the project, including software development, hardware integration, and machine learning implementation.

Daily code review loop:
Prompt: "Please share your code commits from today, including a brief explanation of their purpose and impact on the project. Colleagues, please review each other's commits and provide constructive feedback."

The daily code review loop promotes consistent progress and helps maintain code quality, ensuring that potential issues are identified and addressed early on.

Weekly sprint planning loop:
Prompt: "Let's set up the sprint for the upcoming week. Please suggest tasks based on the project milestones and your area of expertise. We'll prioritize them together and assign responsibilities accordingly."

The weekly sprint planning loop encourages team members to collaborate on task prioritization, ensuring alignment with project goals and a balanced workload.

Monthly release iteration loop:
Prompt: "As we wrap up this release cycle, please provide a summary of the features and improvements included, as well as any lessons learned and potential areas of focus for the next cycle."

The monthly release iteration loop allows for the evaluation of the team's progress, ensuring that lessons learned are integrated into future development cycles and that the project continues to evolve and improve.

Integrating these three loop types into the daily, weekly, and monthly routines of the technical development team will help create a productive and collaborative environment that encourages ongoing progress towards project goals.
