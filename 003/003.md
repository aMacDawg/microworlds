### Scenario 3
#### Description

**Agents**

- A  coalition: a broader grouping of households, generators, and batteries who are interested in buying energy

**Mechanism**

- The coalition, with access to more granular usage data, RL models, and more bargaining power, can better predict its energy needs and participates in a spot market.

**What we aim to demonstrate**

- We aim to demonstrate, given real world data and better predictive models, that an energy federation may trade wholesale energy and reduce the costs of energy for everyone involved.
