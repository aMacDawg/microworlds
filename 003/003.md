## Scenario 3: An Energy Coalition Navigates the Spot Market 

### Description

In this scenario, we model an energy coalition of diverse members seeking to actively participate in their local electricity market. By leveraging access to data and new tools for prediction and optimization, the coalition pursues trading strategies to benefit all of its members. They aim to challenge entrenched interests profiting from the existing system's inefficiencies and power imbalances.  

### Mechanism  

The energy coalition taps into its shared data resources and predictive modeling capabilities to forecast its aggregated energy needs. It then pursues trading decisions in the spot market to meet those needs at the lowest cost while also generating revenue by selling excess energy. The coalition's strategies apply advanced optimization techniques to balance the interests of residential, commercial and industrial consumers as well as distributed energy resource owners. Their goal is an equitable and sustainable solution for the benefit of all members.

### What We Aim to Demonstrate  

We aim to demonstrate the viability and benefits of a decentralized energy coalition participating in a liberalized electricity market. The insights from this analysis can help policymakers, regulators and communities understand how to enable and support such initiatives as mechanisms for empowering all electricity system stakeholders and accelerating the clean energy transition.  

### Modeling Approach

1. **Agents:** Represent the diversity of coalition members including residential, commercial and industrial consumers as well as distributed generators and storage operators. Incorporate their unique energy needs, constraints and objectives. 
2. **Data and Prediction:** Leverage anonymized data from smart meters, sensors and member profiles to forecast hourly energy requirements and potential generation/sales. Apply machine learning and statistical techniques optimized for the available data.
3. **Trading Strategies:** Develop model predictive control and optimization algorithms to maximize the coalition's objectives across all members. Strategies may include arbitraging price differences, bidding into capacity and ancillary services markets, and maintaining reliability. 
4. **Entrenched Interests:** Represent the behaviors and influences of traditional incumbent utilities and large generators. The coalition's strategies aim to counter these interests to benefit of all members.  
5. **Electricity Market:** Model a spot market for energy, capacity and ancillary services with dynamic supply, demand and pricing mechanisms. Allow the coalition to participate as both a buyer and seller.
6. **Scenarios:** Explore how different policy, technology and weather conditions impact the coalition's trading performance, costs, and revenues. Assess the viability and benefits of decentralized coalitions over various scenarios. 
7. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the monetary and environmental impacts of the coalition's strategies on its members. Compare to modeled outcomes if members had remained solely individual actors in the market.

By developing decentralized solution and confronting entrenched interests, this model highlights an alternative path towards equitable and sustainable electricity system transformation. The insights demonstrate the potential of community empowerment and collective action to drive the clean energy transition.
