**Game rules:** The game will begin with a basic set of rules similar to Nomic. Players will have the ability to propose, vote on, and change rules during gameplay, leading to an evolving and dynamic game experience.

**Data visualization and exploration:**** The game will feature a user interface that allows players to explore and visualize game data, similar to Symbolics 3600 Genera. This can include graphical representations of game states, player actions, and other relevant information.

**Graphs and diagrams:** Players will interact with various graphs and diagrams related to applied category theory and open games. These visualizations will be used to guide decision-making and strategy development within the game.

**Game engine compatibility:** The game will be built using a game engine that supports Godot/MuJoCo integrations and jax/rlax libraries for reinforcement learning, allowing for advanced AI-driven gameplay and player interactions.

**Compositional dynamics:** The gameplay will be inspired by the social interaction and engagement found in Magic the Gathering. Players will form teams or groups and compete against each other using various strategies and tactics based on the evolving ruleset and game states.

With this basic structure in place, we can further refine and develop the game by addressing specific aspects of each element and incorporating additional details and features as needed.
